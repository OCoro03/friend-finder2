# friend-finder2

App Overview: Friend Finder is a website that connects individuals with other individuals based on the similiarity of their answers on the survey. These two individuals have now become 'friends' based on their way of thinking.

User Experience: The user accesses the website and is greeted with a welcome page. They hit the survey button and it takes them to the survey. On this page the user answers a series of questions and is then connected with a friend who's answers are similar to the users.

Issues: Currently working on the math to allow friend connections. Without it I am unable to connect one user with another.
